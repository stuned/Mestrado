Since business is not going too well  Fuad also works night shifts in a museum of ancient Egyptian culture. During these long  lonely nights he is repeatedly drawn to a statue representing the seductive ancient goddess ISHTAR. He becomes more and more allured by the goddess as she speaks to him in visions. Eventually he succumbs to her deadly charms. After this pivotal night  Fuad begins a new life  in which murder and cannibalism become his daily bread. He starts to prepare a ritual FEAST to honor his new mistress  a lavish affair dripping with BLOOD  organs  and intestines of human victims. As butchered bodies are heaped upon the Altar of Ishtar  Fuad slowly slips further into madness  until he is no more than the goddess's puppet; and she thirsts for the blood of Fuad's wife and daughter too.,1200000,4046,8708,0,8708,1277187,4306,9268,0,9268,False,True,False,
